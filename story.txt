There was a big banyan tree, where two crows - husband and wife, had prepared a nice nest and made it their home. In the hollow of the same tree, lived a black cobra. 
The crows had a problem because the black cobra would climb up the tree and eat the newborns, whenever the female crow hatched her eggs. They could do nothing to save them. 
The crows went to a jackal, who lived in a nearby banyan tree, to seek his advice. They narrated everything to him and requested his advice for them to get rid of their problem. 
The crows decided to follow the jackal's advice and flew off immediately according to his plan. 
As they flew above the capital, the female crow noticed wealthy women swimming in a lake. They had left gold and pearl necklaces on the banks of the lake, which were guarded by royal servants.
At once the female crow swooped down, and picked up a big necklace in her beak, and started flying slowly. 
When the royal servants noticed her, they picked up sticks and stones, and started throwing at her, and ran to chase her.
